# Webpack ES6 Starter

this repo aims to introduce people to a webpack configuration with ES6 and SASS technologies with an adaptation of the concept of separation of concerns.

## Getting Started

This is a simple starter with all necessary tools for fast prototyping in Vanilla JS. You can use the newest features of Javascript fast and easily. Also, in the stater I included sass technologie for reusability of development comfort.
